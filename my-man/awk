awk '{print}' file # better than sed
awk '{print}' file | head # just 10 lines

'/root/ {print}' file # lines which contains 'root'
'/root/ {print $1}' file # print just first column of lines which contains 'root'
'{print $2, $1}' file # print second and first column
'{print $0}' file # print whole line
'{print NR $0}' file # Number Record
'{print NF}' file # Number of Fileds
'BEGIN{FS="0";} {print}' file # print rows until FS (zero in this case)
